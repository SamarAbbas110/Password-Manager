A simple password manager built using React that allows you to store and manage passwords locally. Note: This is a basic version, and no encryption or secure storage is implemented yet.

Features
Store and manage multiple passwords locally in the browser.
View, edit, and delete stored passwords.
Password data is stored in the browser’s local storage (no database or encryption).
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (for running the project locally)
A code editor (such as VSCode)
Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SamarAbbas110/Password-Manager.git
cd Password-Manager
2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Install Tailwind CSS (Optional but recommended for styling)
bash
Copy code
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Then, initialize Tailwind:

bash
Copy code
npx tailwindcss init
Configure your tailwind.config.js by adding the file paths for React components:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
4. Start the development server
Run the following command to start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Add Password: Input the website name, username, and password into the form. The information will be stored locally in your browser’s local storage.
View Passwords: View a list of stored passwords, with the option to edit or delete them.
Local Storage: The passwords are stored in the browser’s local storage. Note: This means the data is not encrypted or secured and could be accessed by anyone using the same browser.
Important Notes
This project does not implement any encryption or secure database storage. The passwords are stored in the browser’s local storage, which is not secure.
It is recommended to not use this password manager for storing sensitive information in a production environment.
Future versions may implement encryption or secure database storage for better security.
